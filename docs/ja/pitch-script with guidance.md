# Script with Delivery Marks

## Intro

Gm guys, / I’m **Kyohei**.

Let me start / with a simple question.

Do you like / **combat sports**?

I’m a big fan too.

（少し間を空ける）

Combat sports is a **huge** global market, /
but the online fan experience / is still **basic**.

Right now, / fans can only **watch**.
There is no way / to join the excitement / in **real time**.

So we are building /
**IN-FIGHT AMM** —
the first real-time prediction market / made for **combat sports**.

（軽く 1 拍置く）

---

## Team

We are the **Web3 Fighters** team.

James is a former **professional kickboxer**,
and leads Web3 strategy / at one of the biggest / fight promotions in Japan.

I’m a black belt / in **Aikido**,
and I’ve worked as CTO / or Japan Head↓ / at several Web3 startups —
delivering projects for **Sony**, **MAZDA**, **Netflix**, brabrabra.

（力を抜いて）

We know / **combat sports**.
We know / **Web3**.
This mix is **rare**, / and gives us / a real **edge**.

---

## Why IN-FIGHT?

We mapped the full fan journey in combat sports,
and found many chances / for Web3.

But the key moment / is the **live fight**.

Fans feel the strongest **excitement**.
Each event has many matches,so people can join / again and again.

And no real-time prediction market / exists for this space.
It is a clear / **market gap**.

---

## Existing Problems

Current services like **Polymarket** / do not work well for combat sports.

They are too **complex** for casual fans.
Settlement takes **days**,
so users cannot join the next match.
And the odds do not change / with second-by-second / fight data.

（少し強めに）

They simply cannot keep up / with the **speed** of the sport.

This is why we need something **fast**, **simple**,
and built for **live action**.

---

## Solution

This is why / we built / **IN-FIGHT AMM**.

The UI is made / for **sports fans**,
not for pro traders.
It is simple, clean,
and connected / with the live stream.

Our AMM uses / an **LSMR model**.
Odds update **instantly** / as the momentum shifts.
It feels like / you are right there / with the athletes.

（ワンブレスで）

Instant settlement / is our strongest feature.

Normal prediction markets take / **3 to 7 days**.
IN-FIGHT AMM pays out / in **about 10 minutes** / after the fight.
Users can move to the next match / right away.
This speed, fits live combat sports perfectly.

We also use / verified real-time data / via **Nautilus**.
We pull official fight data / from partners / like ONE Championship.
Nautilus signs the data / in a secure enclave,
and sends it on-chain / in **real time**.

Control time, strikes, takedowns —
all trustless, / all **tamper-proof**.

And all of this runs / on **Sui**,
a highly scalable / **Layer-1**.
It enables millions of fans / to use the platform / at the same time.

---

## Demo (12s)

Let me show you / how it works —
just a quick / product demo.

You watch / the live stream,
and place your bet / **instantly**.

As the fight moves,
the odds move / **with it** / in real time.

You see the action / and the numbers / change together.
This is / our **UX**.

---

## Achievements

Here is our **traction**.

We already partner / with one of the biggest / fight promotions in Japan.
We also have access / to other major organizations,
and even have / a former **K-1 champion** / on our team.

At the Sui × ONE Championship Hackathon,
we won **second place**
and **ONE’s Favorite Prize**.

Since then,
we have started / real collaboration talks / with ONE.

---

## Roadmap

Here is / our **roadmap**.

We validated the concept / through several Sui hackathons,
and built / working prototypes.

Now we are moving / into **fundraising**.

We’ve been / in regular contact / with **3RD GEAR**,
a Dentsu group company / and an investor in both Sui and ONE.

We’re also getting advice / from **Kriss** at Scallop —
an amazing mentor.

And we’re having ongoing / conversations / with **Soma Capital**,
a seed investor / in **Kalshi**.

---

## Ending

IN-FIGHT AMM is more than / a prediction market.
It is a new **entry point** / connecting combat sports / and Web3.

It creates / a deeper, more interactive / fan experience.

And this is / only the **start**.

We are not only / building on Sui —
we are bringing / **millions of fans** / onto Sui.

And honestly,
we gained many of these opportunities / thanks to the last Sui hackathon.

Thank you so much.
