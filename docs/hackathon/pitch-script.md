# Pitch Script (5m)

## Intro

Gm guys, I’m Kyohei.

Let me start with a simple question.
Do you like combat sports?
I’m a big fan myself.

Combat sports is a huge global market, but the online fan experience is still very limited.
Today, fans can only watch.
There is no way to join the excitement of the fight in real time.

So we are building InFight AMM — the first real-time prediction market specialized for combat sports.

## Team

We are the Web3 Fighters team.

My co-founder, James Xu, is a former professional kickboxer, and he now leads Web3 strategy at one of Japan’s largest fight promotions.

I’m also a black belt in Aikido, and I have worked as CTO or Head of Japan at several Web3 companies.
I have delivered Web3 projects for Sony, Netflix, and MAZDA.

We deeply understand both combat sports and Web3, and that makes our team very unique.

## Why InFight?

We analyzed the entire fan journey of combat sports and found many Web3 opportunities.
But the most important point is the moment during the fight.

There are three reasons.

First, fans are most excited during the live fight.
Second, one event has many matches, so people can join again and again.
And finally, there is still no real-time prediction market optimized for combat sports.

This is a huge market gap.

## Existing Problems

Existing services like Polymarket are not a good fit for combat sports.

They are too complex for normal fans.
Settlement takes several days, so users cannot reuse their funds for the next match.
And they cannot update odds based on second-by-second fight data.
They simply cannot keep up with the speed of combat sports.

That’s why we need something fast, simple, and designed for live fights.

## Solution

This is why we built InFight AMM.

The UI is designed for sports fans, not for professional crypto traders.
It is simple, clean, and integrated with the live stream.

Our AMM uses the LSMR model.
The odds update instantly as the momentum of the fight changes.
It feels almost like you are fighting together with the athletes.

Our biggest strength is instant settlement.
Traditional prediction markets take 3 to 7 days.
InFight AMM lets users claim their winnings only 10 minutes after the fight ends.
They can immediately join the next match.
This speed fits perfectly with live combat sports.

Another strong point is real-time, fully verified data using Nautilus.
We pull official fight data from ONE Championship and UFC Stats.
Nautilus signs the data inside a secure enclave and sends it on-chain in real time.
Control time, strikes, takedowns — all the stats are trustless and tamper-proof.

And everything runs on Sui.
Sub-second finality and gas fees under one cent make it perfect for events with millions of active fans.

## DEMO (12 seconds)

Let me show you how it works.

You watch the live stream and place your bet instantly.
As the fight moves, the odds change in real time.

You see the action and the numbers move together — that is the InFight AMM experience.

## Achievements

We already have a partnership with one of the largest fight promotions in Japan,
and we have access to most major organizations in the country.
We also have a former K-1 champion on our team.

At the Sui × ONE Championship Hackathon, we won second place and ONE’s Favorite Prize.
Since then, we have started preparing for real collaboration with ONE.

## Roadmap

We validated the business concept at the ONE Hackathon,
and we built a Nautilus-integrated prototype at the Haulout Hackathon.

Now we are moving toward fundraising.
We have been connected to Soma Capital, an early investor in Kalshi.
We also have meetings scheduled with Scallop and DSRV.

We applied to the JR East Startup Program, proposing a prediction market combined with anonymized mobility data.
And we are launching a Web3 education program together with Waseda University.

## Ending

InFight AMM is not just a prediction market.

It is a new entry point that connects combat sports fans around the world to Web3,
and it creates a deeper and more interactive relationship between fans and the sport.

And this is only the beginning.

We are not only building on Sui —
we are bringing tens of millions of combat sports fans onto Sui.

Thank you very much.
