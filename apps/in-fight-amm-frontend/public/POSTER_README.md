## Tips for Best Results

- Use high-quality promotional materials or action shots
- Ensure main subjects (fighters) are clearly visible
- Avoid images with too much text overlay (as we add our own)
- Landscape orientation works best for the layout
- Consider the gradient overlay on the hero image when choosing
