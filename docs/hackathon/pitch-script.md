# InFight AMM Pitch Script (English, Long Version)

## Intro

Gm guys, I’m Kyohei.

Let me start with a question.
Do you like combat sports?
I’m actually a huge fan myself.

Combat sports is a massive global market.
But the online fan experience today is still limited to just watching.
There is no way for fans to join the excitement of the fight in real time.

So we are building InFight AMM —
the world’s first realtime prediction market specialized for combat sports.

## Team

We are the Web3 Fighters team.

My cofounder, James Xu, is a former professional kickboxer.
He now leads Web3 strategy at one of Japan’s largest fight promotions.

I am also a black belt in Aikido, and I have worked as CTO or Head of Japan at multiple Web3 companies.
I’ve delivered Web3 projects for Sony, Netflix, and MAZDA — some of Japan’s most iconic enterprises.

We are a rare team that deeply understands both combat sports and Web3.

## Web3 × Combat Sports Framework

First, we mapped out the full set of Web3 use cases across the combat sports lifecycle, based on real industry knowledge.

There are many opportunities — communitydriven matchmaking, tokenized sponsorship ads for fighters, and more.

We plan to build this full ecosystem over time.
But today, I want to focus on the realtime, infight prediction market, which is the most important moment.

Why?
Because fans are most excited during the fight.
A single event has many matches, so fans can participate again and again.
And most importantly, there is no realtime prediction market specialized for combat sports anywhere in the world.

This is a major market gap.

## Problems with Existing Markets

Existing platforms like Polymarket are not designed for combat sports.

They have evolved for professional traders — too complex for the average sports fan.

Even worse, settlement takes several days.
So if your funds are locked after the first match, you cannot join the second or third match in the same event.

And they cannot update positions at high speed.
They cannot reflect live data — strikes, control time, momentum shifts — on a secondbysecond basis.

Combat sports move fast.
Traditional prediction markets cannot keep up.

This is why we need a new market that is fast, intuitive, and built specifically for combat sports.

## Solution

And that is InFight AMM.

Our UI is designed for sports fans, not for professional crypto traders.
The live stream and the market interface are integrated, so anyone can use it intuitively.

The AMM uses an LSMR model.
The odds update instantly based on the flow of the fight.
When momentum changes, the market reacts immediately.
It feels almost like you’re fighting together with the athletes.

### Our biggest strength — instant settlement

Traditional prediction markets take three to seven days to settle.
InFight AMM lets users claim their winnings only 10 minutes after the fight ends.

This means fans can immediately join the next match in the same event.
This instant settlement perfectly matches the nature of combat sports.

### Our next biggest strength — verified realtime data via Nautilus

We fetch official fight data from ONE Championship and UFC Stats.
Nautilus signs this data inside a secure enclave and sends it onchain.

Control time, strikes, takedowns — all verified, realtime, and trustless.

### Powered by Sui

Everything runs on Sui, with subsecond finality and gas fees under one cent.
This makes it scalable for events with millions of simultaneous fans.

## Demo

Here’s how it works.

You watch the live stream and place your bet.
The odds instantly change as the fight develops.

The action and the numbers move together — that is the InFight AMM experience.

## Achievements: Partnerships

We are already officially partnered with one of Japan’s largest fight promotions.
The first Chinese K1 champion is also part of our team.

We also have strong access to many major fight promotions across Japan.

## Achievements: Hackathons

At the Sui × ONE Championship Hackathon, we won second place and ONE’s Favorite Prize.

This opened the door to real collaboration with ONE, and discussions are already in progress.

## Roadmap

We validated our business at the ONE Hackathon and built a Nautilusintegrated prototype at the Haulout Hackathon.

Next, we are raising funding.
After our hackathon results went viral, we were introduced to Soma Capital — an early investor in Kalshi.
We also have upcoming meetings with Scallop and DSRV to explore yield integration, Japan market entry, and potential investment.

We have applied to the JR East Startup Program, proposing a PoC that integrates anonymized SEAL data with prediction markets.

And we are launching a Web3 education program together with Waseda University.

## Ending

InFight AMM is not just a prediction market.

It is a new entry point that connects combat sports fans around the world to Web3.
And it uses Web3 to create deeper, more interactive relationships between fans and the sport.

And this is only the beginning.

We are not just building on Sui —
we are bringing tens of millions of combat sports fans onto Sui.

Thank you very much.
