# In-Fight AMM Pitch Script (5m)

## Intro

Gm guys, I’m Kyohei.

Let me start with a simple question.
Do you like combat sports?
I’m a big fan too.

Combat sports is a huge global market, but the online fan experience is still basic.
Right now, fans can only watch.
There is no way to join the excitement in real time.

So we are building IN-FIGHT AMM —
the first real-time prediction market made for combat sports.

## Team

We are the Web3 Fighters team.

James is a former professional kickboxer, and he leads Web3 strategy at one of the biggest fight promotions in Japan.

I am a black belt in Aikido, and I have worked as CTO or Head of Japan at several Web3 companies.
I have delivered projects for Sony, Netflix, and MAZDA.

We know combat sports.
We know Web3.
This mix is rare, and it gives us a real edge.

## Why IN-FIGHT?

We mapped the full fan journey in combat sports and found many chances for Web3.
But the key moment is the live fight.

Fans feel the strongest excitement.
Each event has many matches, so people can join again and again.
And no real-time prediction market exists for this space.
It is a clear market gap.

## Existing Problems

Current services like Polymarket do not work well for combat sports.

They are too complex for casual fans.
Settlement takes days, so users cannot join the next match.
And the odds do not change with second-by-second fight data.

They simply cannot keep up with the speed of the sport.

This is why we need something fast, simple, and built for live action.

## Solution

This is why we built In-Fight AMM.

The UI is made for sports fans, not for pro traders.
It is simple, clean, and connected with the live stream.

Our AMM uses an LSMR model.
Odds update instantly as the momentum shifts.
It feels like you are right there with the athletes.

Instant settlement is our strongest feature.
Normal prediction markets take 3 to 7 days.
IN-FIGHT AMM pays out in about 10 minutes after the fight.
Users can move to the next match right away.
This speed fits live combat sports perfectly.

We also use verified real-time data via Nautilus.
We pull official fight data from partners like ONE Championship.
Nautilus signs the data in a secure enclave and sends it on-chain in real time.
Control time, strikes, takedowns — all trustless, all tamper-proof.

And all of this runs on Sui, a highly scalable Layer-1.
It can support millions of fans using the platform at the same time.

## Demo (12 seconds)

Let me show you how it looks.

You watch the live stream and place your bet instantly.
As the fight moves, the odds move with it — in real time.

You see the action and the numbers change together.
This is our UX.

## Achievements

We already have a partnership with one of the biggest fight promotions in Japan.
We also have access to other major organizations.
And a former K-1 champion is part of our team.

At the Sui × ONE Championship Hackathon, we won second place and ONE’s Favorite Prize.
Since then, we have started real collaboration talks with ONE.

## Roadmap

We validated the concept through several Sui hackathons and built working prototypes.
Now we are moving into fundraising.

We are meeting with 3RD GEAR, a Dentsu group company and an investor in both Sui and ONE.
We have had a close relationship with them for a few years.

We are also speaking with Soma Capital, a seed investor in Kalshi,
and Scallop, the No.1 DeFi protocol on Sui.

And we are launching a Web3 education program together with Waseda University.

## Ending

IN-FIGHT AMM is more than a prediction market.
It is a new entry point that connects combat sports and Web3.
It creates a deeper, more interactive fan experience.

And this is only the start.
We are not only building on Sui —
we are bringing millions of fans around the world onto Sui.

Thank you very much.
